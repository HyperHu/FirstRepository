1. find the right repository (branch)
    in SVN, we use the link like https://beisop60.china.nsn-net.net/isource/svnroot/BTS_SC_DSP
    in Git, we use the link like YYYY (https://github.com/HyperHu/FirstRepository.git)
    then what is the difference?
    in SVN, the link is used to determine the branch
        https://beisop60.china.nsn-net.net/isource/svnroot/BTS_SC_DSP/  + branches/p_nyquist
    in Git, the link is same for all branch in this repository. 

2. check out the source code
    in SVN: svn checkout SVN_Link [-r XXX]
    in Git: git clone git_url [local_name], ?? how to define which branch and which reversion?
        -b (--branch) branch_name to define which branch
            if the branch_name didn't exist, then failed. nothing download.
        after clone, use "git checkout HHHH" to change the reversion.

3. do some change
    change context of file
    add\del\move files

4. save the change (locally)
    this is the brilliant of git. (IMHO)

5. git mergetool

6. rebase and merge.
    the difference.
    how to choice.


git remote -v
git remote show origin


tracking branch  -->  upstream branch
git branch -vv
git checkout --track origin/XXX



Note:
    "git reset HEAD <file>" will cancell the previously git add command. 
        Thus, if you change the file after run add command, the version in stage will lost.
    "git checkout -- <file>" will cover the work space by using stage file. 
        Thus, if you change the file after run add command, the version in work space is lost.
