1. find the right repository (branch)
    in SVN, we use the link like XXXX
    in Git, we use the link like YYYY (https://github.com/HyperHu/FirstRepository.git)
    then what is the difference?
    in SVN, the link is used to determine the branch
    in Git, the link is same for all branch in this repository. 

2. check out the source code
    in SVN: svn checkout SVN_Link [-r XXX]
    in Git: git git_url [local_name], ?? how to define which branch and which reversion?
        -b (--branch) branch_name to define which branch
        use git checkout HHHH to define the reversion

3. do some change
    change context of file
    add\del\move files

4. same the change (locally)

5.
